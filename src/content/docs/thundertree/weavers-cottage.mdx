This fallen cottage is a lure for the creatures that lair nearby.
<Aside title="Flavour Text">
Heaps of wreckage litter the interior of this ruin. In one corner stands a broken loom.

Six twig blights lurk in the thicket south of this ruin. Allow each character to attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the blights' Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid being surprised by them.
