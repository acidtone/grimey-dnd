To its south, this farm abuts a field with thick patches of gorse and briars.

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
This ruin looks as if it might once have been a farmhouse. It is now half swallowed by a dense thicket, with trees growing up through its ruined foundations. The lane continues south a short distance past the ruin before ending in an overgrown field.
</Aside>

The thicket east of this ruin is crawling with **eight twig blights**. Any disturbance in the ruined farmhouse (for example, characters rooting around in the rubble) draws the blights' ire.

Each round for 3 rounds, two twig blights head for the south doorway leading into the farmhouse while two more head for the north doorway. The blights attack until destroyed.

## Monsters
<Monster  slug="twig-blight" />

## Awarding Experience Points
Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party destroys the twig blights.
