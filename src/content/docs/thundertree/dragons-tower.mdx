This tower was formerly the home of a human wizard, who was killed fighting the ash zombies that overran Thundertree thirty years ago.
<Aside title="Flavour Text">
At the top of the hill stands a round tower with a cottage attached. Both are in good condition, although half of the tower's roof is gone. A door leads into the cottage, and several arrow-slit windows are visible in the tower. You can't help but notice an eerie quiet in the area and a strange, acrid smell in the air.

The corpses of two hideous giant spiders are sprawled near the edge of the pathway, apparently dragged there. Their bloated bodies are puckered and blistered, and appear to have been mauled by a large animal.  
</Aside>

A young green dragon named Venomfang has recently claimed the tower, having passed over Thundertree while searching Neverwinter Wood for a suitable lair. The giant spider corpses are the former residents of the tower, killed by the dragon after it tore its way through the roof. Since then, Venomfang has been laying low.

## Tower
The dragon lives in the towerâ€”a single room with a 40-foot-high ceiling. A 5-foot-wide staircase circles the interior, rising to the now-opened rooftop that allows the dragon easy access to its new home. Heavy wooden beams and stair supports crisscross the tower interior.

Venomfang does not want to give up such a promising lair, but if the characters reduce the dragon to half its hit points, it climbs to the top of the tower and flies off to fight another day.

## Monsters

## Cottage
The cottage contains dusty furniture draped in webbing, but nothing of value. If the characters make a lot of noise in the cottage, the dragon hears them and steels itself for a fight.


## Treasure
An old wooden chest broken open on the tower floor holds the last of the dead wizard's treasure:
- 800 sp, 
- 150 gp, 
- four silver goblets set with moonstones (60 gp each), 
- a scroll of misty step, and 
- a scroll of lightning bolt.

Venomfang spends much of his time greedily admiring the loot.

<Aside type="tip" title="Hew: +1 battleaxe">
The dragon has barely noticed the most interesting item in its hoard. Beneath the coins is a **rusty old battleaxe of dwarven manufacture**. Runes in Dwarvish on the axe head read, "Hew," and the rust is misleading. 

Hew is a +1 battleaxe that deals maximum damage when the wielder hits a plant creature or an object made of wood. The axe's creator was a dwarf smith who feuded with the dryads of a forest where he cut firewood. Whoever carries the axe feels uneasy whenever he or she travels through a forest.

## Awarding Experience Points
Divide 2,000 XP equally among the characters if the party drives away Venomfang. Given their level, the characters aren't likely to slay the dragon, but it is worth 3,900 XP.
