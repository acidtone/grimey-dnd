This smithy was abandoned long ago.

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
A wide chimney and rotted piles of firewood jumbled outside the walls of this sagging building suggest that it was a smithy in its day.
</Aside>

Two ash zombies are slumped on the floor. When the characters enter, the monsters climb to their feet (spending half their speed to do so). Then they attack. When the zombies have caught sight of the characters, they pursue them no matter where they go.

A variety of old tools—tongs, bellows, hammers, and a pair of iron anvils—are scattered around the interior of this building.

## Monsters
