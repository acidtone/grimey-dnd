Wind and weather have done their work here, and little remains of these houses or their former contents.

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
These ruined, side-by-side cottages look as though they might have been the homes of prosperous shopkeepers or well-off farmers in their time. All that remains are collapsed walls and piles of debris. Several young trees have grown up in the midst of the ruins.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Stealth check: Twig Blights">
The overgrowth conceals a deadly threat - **six twig blights** lurking among the ordinary foliage. Spotting them requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check challenged by the blights' Dexterity (Stealth) check.
</Aside>

These plant monsters are hungry and fight until destroyed. One round after they attack, the twig blights in area 1 join the fray.

## Monsters
<Monster  slug="twig-blight" />

## Treasure
<Aside type="tip" title="DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check">
A merchant who once lived here had a chest full of coins hidden under the flagstone floor of his home. A thorough search of the interior of the eastern cottage and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the old chest among the roots of the tree growing up through the house. The chest contains:
- 700 cp
- 160 sp
- 90 gp

## Awarding Experience Points
Divide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party destroys these twig blights.
