This former general store is not a complete ruin yet, with portions of its tile roof still intact.

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
At an intersection near the middle of the village, a narrow lane winds up the steep hillside to the north. Directly to the south is a ruined building that might have been a store or workshop. Webs stretch across the lane, from the building to the trees on the north side of the road.
</Aside>

Two **giant spiders** hide on the inner walls in this ruined building, so they are not visible from outside. Trailing lines from the webs in the lane allow the spiders to sense when prey is moving through the webs, at which point they nimbly scuttle over the wall and attack. 

<Aside type="caution" title="Passive Perception: 17">
The alert spiders surprise any character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score is less than 17.
</Aside>

## Monsters
<Monster  slug="giant-spider" />

## Webs
The webs fill two squares north of the doorway (and the square marked "6"). 

<Aside type="caution" title="DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check">
The webs are difficult terrain, and a creature trying to move through them must succeed on a **DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check**. On a failure, the creature is restrained in the webs (see the rulebook for the effects of being restrained). A snared creature can take an action each round to attempt to break free with a **DC 12 Strength check**, or it can try to cut its way free by using a light weapon that deals slashing damage. The webs have:
- AC 10, 
- 5 hit points, 
- vulnerability to fire damage, and 
- immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.
</Aside>

Going around the webs is difficult because of the thickets on the north side of the road. Going around the ruined building to the south leads to the twig blights in area 5.

## Treasure
The corpse of an unfortunate adventurer is cocooned in spider silk in the western half of the building. The body is shriveled up and sucked dry, but appears to have been a male elf. The body wears studded leather armor and a shortsword in the scabbard at its hip. A careful search also yields a belt pouch, containing:
- a potion of healing
- 23 gp
- 35 sp

## Awarding Experience Points
Divide 400 XP equally among the characters if the party defeats the giant spiders.
