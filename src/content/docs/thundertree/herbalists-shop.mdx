This was an herb and alchemy shop belonging to the family of Mirna Dendrar, now a resident in Phandalin (see encounter 5 in the "Redbrand Hideout" section).

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
This ruined shop is cluttered with sagging storage shelves and broken furniture. Shards of glass and pieces of pottery glint in the weeds and rubble next to rotted books and casks.
</Aside>

All the reagents and concoctions here have long since been ruined, and the books are unreadable masses of rot. However, a small wooden case is hidden in a compartment beneath the storage shelves. A character searching through the wreckage can find the case with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The check succeeds automatically if Mirna sent the party to find the heirloom.

## Treasure
The case is worthless but contains a gold necklace with a fine emerald pendant (200 gp).

## Awarding Experience Points
Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party returns the necklace to Mirna instead of keeping it.
