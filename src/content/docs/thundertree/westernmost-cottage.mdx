This cottage has seen better days.

Two twig blights hide among the weeds that flank the cottage's open doorway. 

<Aside type="caution" title="Stealth check: Twig Blights">
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the blights, and compare the result to the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine if the blights are spotted.
</Aside>

The blights do not attack on their own (except in self-defense) but quickly come to the aid of the twig blights in area 2 if combat erupts there.

## Monsters
<Monster  slug="twig-blight" />

## Awarding Experience Points
Divide 50 XP equally among the characters if the party destroys the twig blights.
