<Aside title="Flavour Text">
Upon arrival at Presto's shop (which is less a shop and more of a lodging), even the least perceptive member of the party can tell the place has been ransacked. Scattered papers and smashed vials line the floor, a number of drawers have been pulled out of a small wooden desk and emptied whole hog on the floor, and even Presto's wardrobe has been tipped over, his prized collection of topcoats and fancy hats in a heap underneath the smashed piece of furniture.

Upon examining the wreckage of his home and place of business, determined by rolling on the Random Residences table (pg. 245), Presto's heart sinks. “My journal...it's gone,” he explains, pointing to a small hidden panel cracked along the wardrobe's back. “Who would do this?”
Any player choosing to investigate the scene of
this crime will find a big mess and a lot of spilled potions, as well as green chemical burns along the
floor in certain areas where some of the more volatile ingredients in Presto's potions have seeped into the woodwork. A player succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check will notice two pieces of folded parchment (pictured here) among the mess.
If no player succeeds on this check, Presto can offer
a potion that promises to “help them see more clearly,” boosting their Perception and Investigation skills by +5 for one hour. Under the influence of this potion, they can look again. Presto can also take the potion himself and discover the parchment.

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
Upon reviewing the contents of the discovered parchment, it all clicks into place for Presto:
> "Hold! I can't believe it. We worked together for years, perfecting our methods - he never asked for more pay, he always showed up on time. He mied all the potions for FeatFest while I finalized my sales pitch... And now I find out he's been planning to stab me in the back! You think you know someone, then, Prest--- Presto Change---"

> "Ohhhh you have to find him. If he has my notebook, then he has my formulas. You have to find him!"

</Aside>

Looking around Presto's shop, the party sees numerous unlabeled vials that are still intact. Presto offers them to the group if they promise to bring Hold to justice.

## Presto's Personal Potion Stash
- 1d4 potion(s) of haste
- 1d4 potion(s) of perception (pg. 17) 
- 1d4 potion(s) of long rest (pg. 17)
- 1d4 potion(s) of greater healing
- 1 potion of enlarge
- 1 potion of spider climb

Taking the potion of perception reveals just enough of the scent of Hold's cologne in the air to track his path through the streets toward the print shop. If none in the party choose to avail themselves of Presto's potion of perception, Presto can lead them outside, suggesting they check in with the print shop to see if he's gone to pick up his fliers.
