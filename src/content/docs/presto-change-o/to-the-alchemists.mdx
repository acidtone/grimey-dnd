After escaping from FeatFest, Presto leads the party through the narrow stone streets of the town as quickly as he can. The town is in chaos, as those who attended the festival but didn't partake in any of Presto's wares are hurriedly fleeing in fear from those who did.
At GM discretion, use the maps on pgs. 221-225, rolling three times on the Random Rooftops & Alleys table on pg. 221 to determine which street leads where. If an alleyway suggests an encounter, replace the antagonist(s) with entries from the FeatFest Gone Wild table.
Alternatively, allow your players to shuttle Presto to his shop as efficiently, quickly and/or stealthily as possible.

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
As you journey to Presto's shop, he starts lamenting his circumstances.
> "I swear on my life, I don't know why this is happening. Hold and I tested these potions with exacting standards - the best! The top! Presto Change - Ohhhh my Gods there's more of them!"

<Aside type="danger" title="Variant Encounter (optional) - FeatFest Gone Wild">
Roll 1d8 per party member to determine what variety of festivalgoers are menacing Presto. Because Presto dispensed multiple samples of similar potions, a repeated number indicates more than one person was affected by the same type of potion in a similar way.

| 1d8      | Presto is under attack from... |
| -------- | -------                        |
| 1 | ...a human whose anti-aging cream transformed them into an **Ageless Hag**. |
| 2 | ...a **Flame-Spitting Toddler** who shoots gouts of fire each time they open their mouth |
| 3 | ...a formerly shy half-elf who is now a **Shy Banshee** with self control issues. |
| 4 | ...a balding human whose hair tonic turned him into a **Balding Werewolf**. |
| 5 | ...an ax-wielding **Towering Halfling** whose wish to be taller blew up in his face. |
| 6 | ...a dwarven man who wanted clear skin is now an **Acid Dwarf** with a melting face. |
| 7 | ...a **Stone-Fisted Brawler** who is looking for someone to punch. |
| 8 | ...GM's choice OR roll 2d8 and add 2 more FeatFest-goers. |
