After escaping from FeatFest, Presto leads the party through the narrow stone streets of the town as quickly as he can. The town is in chaos, as those who attended the festival but didn't partake in any of Presto's wares are hurriedly fleeing in fear from those who did.
At GM discretion, use the maps on pgs. 221-225, rolling three times on the Random Rooftops & Alleys table on pg. 221 to determine which street leads where. If an alleyway suggests an encounter, replace the antagonist(s) with entries from the FeatFest Gone Wild table.
Alternatively, allow your players to shuttle Presto to his shop as efficiently, quickly and/or stealthily as possible.

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
As you journey to Presto's shop, he starts lamenting his circumstances.
