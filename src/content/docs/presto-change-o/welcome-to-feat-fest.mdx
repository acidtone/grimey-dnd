The entrance to FeatFest is a colorful affair and a feast for the senses. The smell of spit-roasted meat permeates the air, and tests of skill seem to present themselves at every turn. It is, for many in the region, the happiest day of the year and smiles adorn every face.

Notable details include:
- A small fighting ring where a grappler named Tater
Von Spud is taking on challengers.
- An archery range where a female half-elf compels
players to try their luck at hitting a moving target. • A meat pie-eating contest led by a heavy-set
human male.
- A covered wagon that's been turned into a
traveling storefront, described below.

<Aside title="Flavour Text">
A voice suddenly rises over the entire crowd, hawking potions and other wares that promise to amaze and astound. In fact, he's so compelling that the skill challenges in the area have come to a standstill and his booth, a horsedrawn wagon that says "The amazing Presto, Alchemist Extraordinaire" appears to be the only one currently in operation. 

> "Come one, come all, make big from small! Want speed? Drinks these! Need brawn, try one! If you fancy a kiss, just put this to your lips and you'll soon be smootching your prize! Presto Change-o! Potions and lotions and tinctures that thrill - improve your skills, cure your ills, pay your bills with these pills! Grow gills with these vials! Your denials and trials will be no match for my batch of notable potables! Presto Change-o! Don't ask me - try for free!"

</Aside>

Whether or not anyone in the party chooses to try one of Presto's potions (see table at right), he will direct his assistant Hold Hammerhearth to offer one to Tater Von Spud, a strongman in his own right but who, after consuming, attests he feels much stronger. As if to prove the point, Tater lifts two other festivalgoers directly over his head without breaking a sweat. As soon as it appears Presto's potions are effective, there is a run on the small little shop from the attendant crowd, who begin clamoring for a chance at greatness. The crowd gets louder and more animated as the potions take effect and begin granting them everything Presto promised.

<Aside type="tip" title="Participation">
If the party wishes, Presto has numerous potions to sample, free of charge. Note: Potion effects do not stack, and Presto only has one sample per person.

Players should feel free to explore FeatFest for opportunities to test the potions' efficacy.
</Aside>

Once the run on Presto's sample supply has come to a close, he encourages all who have sampled his wares to try their hand at some of FeatFest's games of skill. Exploring FeatFest under the influence of Presto's potions could feel like an adventure unto itself, as players test their newfound abilities at the festival's various booths along the midway.

This stage of the adventure should last as long as your players' attention requires.
