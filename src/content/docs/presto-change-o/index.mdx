At the town's Feats of Valor Festival, a silver-tongued salesman convinces several attendees to sample his collection of potions, promising to enhance their speed, strength, smarts and sex appeal. When the potions take effect, they do exactly as promised, but it's soon revealed these benefits come with a cost, as those who've chosen to consume them start to change for the worse. The party must work together to prevent festival-goers from destroying themselves and the town, while trying to find the root cause of all this unrest in order to put a stop to it.

## Setting Up
The first sunny day in what seems like ages sets the stage for the area's Feats of Valor Festival, or “FeatFest,” held near the center of town. The adventure will also move beyond the grounds of the festival to a handful of random locations, which should be determined beforehand: Roll once on the Random Shops & Guilds table, once on the Random Residences table and determine whether or not you want to use random alleys and tunnels for Parts 4 and 6 of this adventure. If so, roll three times each on the Random Rooftops & Alleys table and Random Tunnel table to set those maps in your mind. The final showdown, if it occurs, will take place in Hold's Stronghold. If the party has previously carried out quests together, the Feats of Valor Festival could be held in their honor as a tribute from the town. If this is the party's first adventure together, FeatFest is the talk of the region and is not to be missed—in fact, most shops are closed, as merchants set up small booths at the festival in order to take advantage of the crowds. The loudest voice near the festival entrance has already gathered an impressive group of onlookers. His name is **Preston Glimbow—the Amazing Presto**, to his friends—and he's got some potions to sell.
