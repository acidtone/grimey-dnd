As Presto marvels at the success of his first foray into self-promotion, a loud groan and sudden shriek can be heard emanating from the fighting pit, as Tater Von Spud suddenly starts to double in size, his skin stretching, bones creaking, eyes wide with fear and confusion. He leaps out of the fighting pit in a blind rage and charges out the entrance of FeatFest, across the street and headlong into the nearest storefront (roll on the Random Shops & Guilds table, pg. 245), crashing through its outer wall.

Recognizing a group who can handle themselves, Presto quickly encourages the party to subdue but not kill the grappler, and offers them gold for their trouble. He is as bewildered by this event as anyone else and has no answer for why it's taken placeâ€”but he does fear for Tater's safety and is insistent that the party help him keep the peace. He'll pay whatever it takes.

<Aside title="Encounter Variant (optional): Potions Have Consequences">
At the end of Part 2 of this adventure, each member of the party who sampled a potion from Presto's cart must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the following additional potion effects are triggered:

**JOLLY GIANT STRENGTH POTION**
- The creature finds everything hilarious and 
- At the start of each turn must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10) or fall prone in a giggle fit.

**POTION OF ELVISH AIMING**
- The creature has disadvantage on all saving throws, as their vision is so keen they are overwhelmed.

**ROCK AND A HARD PLACE POTION**
- The creature feels their flesh start to burn from underneath, 
- suffering 20 points of acid damage and 2 points of exhaustion.

**BRAIN-BOOSTER SERUM**
- The creature's synapses are firing so fast they can't focus. 
- They have **-5 to Charisma and disadvantage on Concentration saves**.

**SAGE WISDOM POTION**
- The creature ages 100 years. 
- Their **movement is reduced by half** and their **Intelligence is reduced by 2** as senility sets in.

**POTION OF FIERY CHARISMA**
- The creature's tongue moves so rapidly that each time they speak small flames shoot out, 
- dealing **1d6 fire damage** to anyone directly in front of them.
</Aside>

If the party gives chase, they encounter the raging Tater within the shop. The grappler is now a **berserker** with 24 (+7) Strength, whose preferred attack method is to grapple and throw members of the party at one another.

If the party manages to subdue Tater, they hear more screams emanating from FeatFest.
