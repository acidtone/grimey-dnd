<Aside title="Encounter Variant (optional): Potions Have Consequences">
An acrid, chemical smell hits your nostrils as you suddenly find yourself in a dark, warehouse-like space, a long forgotten storeroom that has been transformed into a mad alchemists laboratory. A row of barrels lines the back wall of the space and you hear harried clattering coming from behind them. Along the opposite wall is a pristine collection of hats in various shapes and sizes. A few more vials smash and an awful growl carries over the barrel wall. A giant dwarven head rises just over the was as Hold triples in size.
</Aside>

Hold will fight until subdued or killed. The effects of his potions will last for one hour. The party can choose to handle the encounter however they see fit.

Players attempting to converse with Hold in an effort to reason with, persuade or intimidate him will find him too enraged and potion-powered to make much headway, and are more likely to be met with a thrown barrel to the face than a handshake or acknowledgement of his own wrongdoing.

The barrels in Hold's shop are full of various liquids and chemicals and can produce their own hazards when thrown (see pg. 23).
