As the party travels toward the print shop, either with or without Presto, they see a figure who looks an awful lot like Hold Hammerhearth slipping into a sewer grate at the end of a nearby alleyway.

If they choose to give chase, roll three times on the Random Tunnel table on pg. 229 to determine the environment into which the party is following Hold, who always seems to be just out of reach of their spells and weapons.

Hold evades the party through a series of three tunnels—they're following his shadow more than the man—and is attempting to slow them down any way he can. He's on his way to the underground lab where he's been developing potions behind Presto's back.

If the party loses sight of Hold, they'll eventually run into a tunnel with a large wooden door at the end, with sounds echoing from within what appears to be Hold's Stronghold (pg. 23).

## Variant Encounters
<Aside type="note" title="Encounter Variant (Optional) - Hold's Helpers">
Upon being pursued by the party, Hold panics and starts throwing random vials at them or at nearby creatures. Roll 1d6 on the table below for each tunnel entered.

| 1d6 |  In an effort to escape, Hold... |
| --- | -------------------------------- |
| 1 | ...throws an enlarge potion at 1d4 **rats**, who become large and aggressive. |
| 2 | ...pitches a potion at a spider's web, which immediately creates a **giant spider**. |
| 3 | ...hurls a potion at the party, which creates a *fireball* 10ft ahead of them. |
| 4 | ...quickly consumes a potion and suddenly disappears. |
| 5 | ...slams a vial against a wall, which collapses, revealing the lair of an angry sewer **crocodile**. |
| 6 | ...has set a trap in this portion of the tunnel using glass jars of acid. The tripwire is easy enough to notice **DC 15**. If it's tripped, **1d4 members of the party take 2d4 acid damage** on a failed **DC 12 Dexterity saving throw**.
