<Aside type="tip" title="Flavour Text">
Investigating the source of the commotion at FeatFest reveals dozens of attendees in the throes of dramatic transformations. Giant hulking mothers awkwardly chase after their unruly, fire-breathing children. A few attendees hoping to increase their speed now teeter on monstrous, stilt-like legs that at least 20 ft. long. A lovely couple who were wrapped in an amorous embrace after the effects of Presto's patent-pending "Sealed with a Kiss" love potion took hold are now attempting to eat one another. It is, in short, an absolute horror show - and Presto is right in the middle, sweating, swearing and screaming for aid.

Presto begs the party to protect him and escort him to his shop, claiming he must have been sabotaged. He's certain he has a way to reverse this mess: it's all in his notebook back in his study. He is both genuine in his desire to solve the problem and genuinely terrified, as angry customers surround him hoping to secure some retribution.

<Aside title="DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check">
A successful check would reveal that most, if not all, of these afflictions could likely be removed with the power of a greater restoration spell, but with so many afflicted, Presto is certain he has a faster solution within his study and encourages the party to help him get to it.

<Aside type="danger" title="Variant Encounter (optional) - FeatFest Gone Wild">
Roll 1d8 per party member to determine what variety of festivalgoers are menacing Presto. Because Presto dispensed multiple samples of similar potions, a repeated number indicates more than one person was affected by the same type of potion in a similar way.

| 1d8      | Presto is under attack from... |
| -------- | -------                        |
| 1 | ...a human whose anti-aging cream transformed them into an **Ageless Hag**. |
| 2 | ...a **Flame-Spitting Toddler** who shoots gouts of fire each time they open their mouth |
| 3 | ...a formerly shy half-elf who is now a **Shy Banshee** with self control issues. |
| 4 | ...a balding human whose hair tonic turned him into a **Balding Werewolf**. |
| 5 | ...an ax-wielding **Towering Halfling** whose wish to be taller blew up in his face. |
| 6 | ...a dwarven man who wanted clear skin is now an **Acid Dwarf** with a melting face. |
| 7 | ...a **Stone-Fisted Brawler** who is looking for someone to punch. |
| 8 | ...GM's choice OR roll 2d8 and add 2 more FeatFest-goers. |
