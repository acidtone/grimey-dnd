<Aside type="tip" title="Flavour Text">
Investigating the source of the commotion at FeatFest reveals dozens of attendees in the throes of dramatic transformations. Giant hulking mothers awkwardly chase after their unruly, fire-breathing children. A few attendees hoping to increase their speed now teeter on monstrous, stilt-like legs that at least 20 ft. long. A lovely couple who were wrapped in an amorous embrace after the effects of Presto's patent-pending "Sealed with a Kiss" love potion took hold are now attempting to eat one another. It is, in short, an absolute horror show - and Presto is right in the middle, sweating, swearing and screaming for aid.

Presto begs the party to protect him and escort him to his shop, claiming he must have been sabotaged. He's certain he has a way to reverse this mess: it's all in his notebook back in his study. He is both genuine in his desire to solve the problem and genuinely terrified, as angry customers surround him hoping to secure some retribution.

<Aside title="DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check">
A successful check would reveal that most, if not all, of these afflictions could likely be removed with the power of a greater restoration spell, but with so many afflicted, Presto is certain he has a faster solution within his study and encourages the party to help him get to it.
