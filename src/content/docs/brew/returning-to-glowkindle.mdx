The bearded Gnome will be waiting anxiously by the trapdoor that leads to the cellar. Once the adventurers return he will quiz them on how their journey went, preferably over a pint or two!

He will be very happy to pay the adventurers and is more than happy to let them keep any valuables they found in the old cellars.

Characters that have helped to clear out the cellars of the Wizard's Tower Brewery each earn an extra **100xp** or enough to allow them to reach second level, whichever is higher.
