<Aside title="Flavour Text">
*In the center of the small room ahead of you is a large stone well, topped with a wooden handle and the rotten remnants of a heavily frayed rope that descends into the shaft. In the far right corner the ceiling has collapsed slightly, and a narrow shaft ofweak sunlight shines through a narrow hole. To the far left is a plain wooden table, crusted with dirt and dust and laden with old plates, buckets and other strange pieces of tableware.*

<Aside type="tip" title="Silver Plates (50gp): DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check">
Anyone searching the room, or who examines the table directly, will notice that several of the old plates are made from tarnished silver. Once cleaned up, the set should be worth around **50gp**.
</Aside>

## Giant Centipedes
Any adventurer who crosses the room without attempting to
move quietly, however, will attract the attention of three Giant Centipedes that crawl up from within the well. The creatures will attempt to knock an adventurer unconscious and then drag them down the well so they can eat the unlucky victim at their leisure.

The well shaft is 50 ft. deep and has around 10 ft. of standing water at the bottom that will break the fall of anyone who falls in.
