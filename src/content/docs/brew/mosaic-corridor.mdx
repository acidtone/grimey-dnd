<Aside title="Flavour Text">
*Through the hole in the wall you can see a dusty stone corridor, its floor lying around a foot below that of the cellar where you stand.*

*Over to the left you can see the start of a staircase buried in collapsed masonry, earth and rubble that block the way completely. To the right the passage heads around a corner, but on the wall you can just make out what appears to be writing in a clear gold script.*
</Aside>

This is the first area in the basement of the old Wizard's Tower. The staircase leading to its upper levels has been completely blocked by a collapsed ceiling.

The writing has been engraved on the wall in golden script that appears to be shining slightly, even in complete darkness. It is written in Common and reads:


<Aside type="tip" title="Golden Script">
Dawn breaks with stirring air,
As sun shines down on new day fair

Midday blaze bakes earth and grass,
The farmer waits for heat to pass

Evening cool brings water, wine,
Drink and laughter passing time

Night sees shining, roaring fire, 
as wood and coals burn on the pyre"
</Aside>

The passageway continues to the left and ends with two doorways, one heading left and the other straight on. In front of them is a 20 ft. section of floor covered in a mosaic that depicts a rural scene

It shows the sun, the sky, a hillside and a river. There are four 5 ft. panels, each showing the scene at a different time of day.

However, as soon as they draw near the adventurers will notice that two halves of a Giant Rat seemingly cut by a giant blade lie on the river section of the second and third panels.

The mosaic is a trap, and standing on the wrong portions of the floor causes a large blade to slice at the trespasser. The safe areas relate to which of the four elements was mentioned in the appropriate verse. They are:
- First panel - Air (Sky)
- Second panel - Earth (Hill)
- Third panel - Water (River)
- Fourth panel - Fire (Fire)

<Aside type="danger" title="Unsafe Floor area (1d10 damage): DC 12 Dexterity Save">
Any creature standing on an unsafe area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking **5 (1 d10) damage** on a failure or half as much on a success.
</Aside>
This trap activates each time a creature steps on an unsafe panel.
