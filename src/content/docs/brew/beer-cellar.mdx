<Aside title="Flavour Text">
*The wooden stairs creak as you descend into the cool, dry air of the cellar, which is infused with the smell of beer and damp fur. Somewhere in the darkness you hear the scrabbling sound of claws on floorboards and a faint squeaking noise.*
</Aside>

- **The cellar is completely dark**
- Much of floor is taken up by barrels and casks of beer that make it hard to see the entire room at once. 
- The only relatively clear area is towards the far side of the cellar, which has a dirt floor littered with stones and workman's tools. 

<Aside type="tip" title="Adventurers with Darkvision or lit torches">
Will be able to make out the hole in the wall mentioned by Glowkindle. The hole is around 4 ft. high and 3 ft. wide.
</Aside>

## Giant Rats
Eight Giant Rats (DM's Basic Rules p27) are lurking in the shadows and behind barrels.
<Aside type="danger" title="DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check">
Spot the rats before they attack. Otherwise, the rats get a Surprise Round. Once more than half of the adventurers have entered the room they will attempt an ambush. 
</Aside>
- **Once five Giant Rats have been killed** the survivors will attempt to flee back through the hole in the wall.
- Any that successfully escape will be killed in the trap in the Mosaic Corridor.
- The Giant Rats will not attempt to use any tactics beyond swarming the adventurers.
